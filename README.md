# tablepress-odd-even-rowspan

This is a simple extension to the Wordpress plugin [TablePress](https://tablepress.org/). It allows to improve handling of odd / even alternation applied on rows in case of row spans.

If two or more consecutive rows have their first column row spanned, then the applied odd / even CSS class will not be changed.

This allows a better graphical rendering.

Example of usage [here](https://mrules.xyz/en/addons-properties/).

To use, just put the "tablepress-odd-even-rowspan" directory directly in your wordpress plugin directory and activate it.
